Make Firefox addon called "Spy Duck" that is used to find text specified in the filter tab, which searches all elements that match the given type and class. A second mode detects changes of the selected element for a difference in the stored hash. The user can use an eye-dropper to select and add the current website and selected element's type and class as a job for the text scraper to search all matching element types and classes for the filter's text. There is a search-box to find already defined jobs. A separate tab for filtering jobs that aren't using the difference check, where the user can give each filter a name, keywords and words to exclude. The Run tab to execute all or selected jobs sequentially, opening a new window that switches to the results table when done. Config tab for discord_webhook, sheduling runs every X hours (default 1) between certain times on selected days (default 0800-1800 on weekdays). Addon icon to display number of results, play sound when complete and can open the results in a webtable. Make the addon look nice and professional, with tabs having names with icons.
Make it easy for me to read and understand comments and for Claude 3.7 Sonnet to continue building and modifying the addon in separate chats.
Example element: {"name": "Dlala Studios", "url": "https://www.dlalastudios.com/careers/", "tag": "div", "class": "job-details"}, the website has 3 matching elements that contain "QA Tester", "Programmer" and "HR". "HR" is filtered out from the results table as it is not defined within the filter tab.
